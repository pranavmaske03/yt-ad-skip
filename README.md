# youtube_ad_skip
Browser extension to skip YouTube Advertisements automatically.

## How does it work?
The script finds the `movie_player` element of YouTube and sets the current time to the duration of the ad so that we immediately move to the end of the ad essentially skipping the ads.
Note: Disable Ad Blocker on YouTube for this to work

## Local Setup

- Clone git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/HarshKorde5/youtube_ad_skip.git
```

- In Firefox, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` page -> click `Load Temporary Add-on...` button -> select `manifest.json` file in the extension's directory.
- In Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/` page -> check `Developer mode` -> Click `Load unpacked` and select the extension folder `youtube_ad_skip`
